# PowerBI-Portfolio
# About this project

I acted as a BI Developer for MavenTech, a hardware supplier for large enterprises. The company had recently adopted a CRM system to track sales opportunities, but lacked visibility beyond the platform.
To address this, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that allowed sales managers to monitor quarterly team performance.
Dataset
- Exported CRM records from Oct 2016 – Dec 2017
- Included opportunity details: product, account, and win/loss outcomes
Key Assumptions & Design Goals
- Sales managers need actionable insights on team and individual KPIs
- Core KPI: total sales value; supporting metrics: number of deals, conversion %, average deal size
- Managers want to identify underperforming team members, compare against business averages, and focus efforts for the quarter
- Primary view: their own team, with optional comparisons to other teams (no row-level security required)
- Current quarter assumed as Q4 2017, though the dashboard is designed for ongoing updates
Dashboard Features
- User-friendly design for non-technical audiences
- Help page explaining functionality and metric definitions
- Ensures managers can confidently navigate, interpret results, and act on insights
