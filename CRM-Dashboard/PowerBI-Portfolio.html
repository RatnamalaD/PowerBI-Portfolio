      <h2>About this Project</h2>
      <p>
        For the Maven Sales Challenge, I played the role of a BI Developer for MavenTech, 
        a company that specializes in selling computer hardware to large businesses. 
        They've been using a new CRM system to track their sales opportunities but had 
        no visibility of the data outside of the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to enable sales managers to track 
        their team's quarterly performance.

      <h2>The Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset contained records exported from MavenTech's CRM from October 2016 to December 2017. 
        It held details of opportunities with associated information such as product, account, and 
        whether the sale was won or lost.

      <h2>Key Assumptions</h2>
      <p>
        When creating an interactive dashboard, I always like to chat with the users to make sure I 
        truly understand the intended purpose and the questions they seek to answer. In the absence 
        of being able to chat with the sales managers, I made the following key assumptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sales managers want to view the current state of play for their team and obtain actionable insights.</li>
        <li>Key questions include:
          <ul>
            <li>How is my team tracking against KPIs?</li>
            <li>Are there team members who require extra support?</li>
            <li>Where should I focus efforts to improve performance?</li>
            <li>Is my team performing above average compared to the rest of the business?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Main KPI: Dollar value of sales made.</li>
        <li>Other important metrics: number of sales, conversion %, average sales value.</li>
        <li>Managers may want to compare performance across teams or over time.</li>
        <li>Focus is on team-level dashboards rather than executive-level comparisons.</li>
        <li>Assumed "Current quarter" is Q4 2017, but dashboard would update continuously in practice.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Dashboard Section -->
  <section id="dashboard">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Dashboard</h2>
      <p>
        As the dashboard is interactive, I focused on making it user-friendly for audiences who may not 
        use Power BI every day. If sales managers don't feel comfortable using the dashboard, there's 
        no value to be gained.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason, I added a help page covering basic functionality and definitions of key metrics. 
        This ensures managers can confidently navigate the dashboard, clearly interpret the information, 
        and answer their key questions.
